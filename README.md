---

# **9. FULL MANAGEMENT CONTRACT MODEL**

### **Landlord says rent is ₦2,000,000/year.**

We evaluate the property → calculate maintenance → propose:

* DomiHive listing price: ₦2,200,000 (10% markup)
* Landlord receives: ₦2,000,000 minus evaluated clacculated maintenace scope
* DomiHive keeps: ₦200,000

### **Contract Includes:**

* Rent increase schedule
* Maintenance responsibilities
* Reporting frequency
* Penalties

# **10. SALES CONTRACT MODEL (BUY SECTOR)**

When an owner wants DomiHive to sell their home:

* We inspect
* We evaluate
* We sign a Sales Mandate Contract
* DomiHive adds markup (10–20%)
* Buyer pays → owner gets original price → DomiHive keeps markup

Upsell:
After buying, we ask buyer:
**“Do you want us to manage this property for you?”**
This creates recurring revenue.

# **14. MARKET ENTRY STRATEGY (THE BIG QUESTION YOU ASKED)**

### **How can a startup with NO MONEY, NO NETWORK, NO EXPERIENCE break into the real estate system?**

Here is the **realistic, industry-approved path**:

---

## **STEP 1 — Launch MVP + Build Credibility (Digital First)**

People take tech companies serious when they see:

* A clean app
* A functional website
* Professional branding
* Clear value proposition
* Verified listings (even 5–10 units is enough at start)

---

## **STEP 2 — Find Your First 5–10 Landlord Partners Using SMART TARGETING**

You don’t go to random landlords.

You target:

### **A. Diaspora owners**

They ALWAYS need management.

### **B. Developers with many units**

They care about:

* tenant supply
* management reliability
* digital reporting

### **C. Busy professionals with rental income**

They want stress-free management.

---

## **STEP 3 — Create a “Proof of Professionalism Pack”**

To convince landlords, prepare:

* Company profile PDF
* Management contract template
* Sample reporting
* Property standards checklist
* Team profiles
* Business registration documents

Now you look like a **real company**, not a random startup.

---

## **STEP 4 — Use These Acquisition Channels**

1. **Instagram ads**
2. **Cold outreach to developers**
3. **Go to estate open days**
4. **Use diaspora communities (WhatsApp groups)**
5. **Churches and organizations**
6. **LinkedIn networking**
7. **Partnership with facility managers**

---

## **STEP 5 — Deliver Excellent Service to First Tenants**

The first 10 tenants become your:

* testimonials
* video reviews
* trust-builders
* social proof
* referrals

This drives traction without spending money.

---

## **STEP 6 — Use Momentum to Raise Investment**

After traction:

* Show rentals completed
* Show revenue
* Show active properties
* Show user dashboards
* Show growth plan

Investors now take you seriously.

---

## **STEP 7 — Scale to Abuja & Ibadan**

Once Lagos is stable.

---

## **STEP 8 — Use Revenue to Expand Nationwide**

Delta → Port Harcourt → Kano → Enugu → others.

---

# **15. NEXT STEP AFTER MVP (VERY IMPORTANT)**

You asked:
“After the MVP is done, what EXACTLY is our next big move?”

Here is the roadmap:

### **1. Property Acquisition Sprint (50 units target)**

Your first metric investors measure is:
**How many verified units do you control?**

### **2. Close 10 Full-Management Contracts**

This is your long-term revenue engine.

### **3. Launch “Verified DomiHive Inspection Team”**

Uniforms, ID cards, professionalism.

### **4. Start Aggressive Social Proof Campaign**

Videos of inspections
Tenant testimonials
Before-after maintenance
Developer partnerships

### **5. Hire Key Staff (gradually)**

Don’t hire everyone at once.
Hire based on active demand.

### **6. Upgrade Tech**

Based on tenant feedback.

### **7. Raise Pre-seed Funding**

Using traction, not idea.

---

# **16. FUTURE EXPANSION**

* Shortlet dashboard
* Commercial dashboard
* Owner Analytics Portal
* AI-powered rent pricing
* Home services marketplace
* International expansion
* Smart IoT integrations

---

### **17. — Raise Micro-Investments**

After you have:

* MVP
* 5–10 properties
* Advisory board
* Case studies

You can raise:

* ₦1 million–₦10 million
  from small investors or angel round.

---

### **Step 18 — Scale Operations**

Hire properly, outsource maintenance, standardize processes.

This is how you climb the real estate ladder without money.
